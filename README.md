# Cypress sample

This is a sample project showing how Cypress can be used to cover some simple end-to-end flows for Company Cam, including GitHub actions.

## Getting started

- Install the latest version of node and NPM on your machine
- Run `npm i` to install dependencies
- Make a copy of `cypress.env.example.json` and rename it to `cypress.env.json`, adding in the username and password for your test environment.
- Run `npx cypress open` and Cypres should open, allowing you to run tests!
